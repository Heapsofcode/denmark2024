        <p>
          Listed here are some of the main local attractions that I think you
          guys would appreciate. These things will take a good chunk of time in
          a day and mostly require a ticket to enter or explore fully. Each
          section also contains a link to the official websites so you can get
          some more details. We did visit Jelling on your last visit Wendy and
          we are more than happy to revisit if Gordon would be interested. The
          castle also contains a huge classic car collection that I thought
          would be particularly interesting to Gordon, again there are more
          details on the actual website.
