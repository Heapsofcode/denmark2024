      <h2>Main Attractions</h2>
      <p>
        Listed here are some of the main local attractions that I think you guys
        would appreciate. Each section also contains a link to the official
        websites so you can get some more details. We did visit Jelling on your
        last visit Wendy and we are more than happy to revisit if Gordon would
        be interested. The castle also contains a huge classic car collection
        that I thought would be particularly interesting to Gordon, again there
        are more details on the actual website.
